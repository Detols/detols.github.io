				<h2 class="subtitle">Why did this development stop</h2>
				<h4 class="subdate">April 15th, 2018</h4>
				
				<p class="post">
				I'm back, and it's been at least a few months since I did a tiny update on myself. If you've noticed in the projects tab, I actually added 
				and new 'In Progress' project. I've been recruited for a very simple job, to write data for puzzles and perhaps even write functions. Honestly,
				I was sort of excited going into it because it seemed like a coding task and that I would learn something from this. But all I've been doing is
				designing puzzles, putting it into the data file or the beta file for testing, then pushing it, and waiting. I'm pretty grateful that Ken gave me
				a task but I'm also upset with the fact I'm not really getting much out of this but some insight to the code (which I've definitely learned quite a bit through).
				I had the option to say no, but I didn't because, I guess I expected more. 
				
				<br></br>
				
				After this task is done, I need to find my motivation to code again. Whether it is to upgrade and update this site, or to design a game and create it,
				something has to happen. I'm not progressing with my free time, other than making money off my full-time job in the food industry. That's not how I want
				to spend this opportunity. 
				
				<br></br>
				
				I hope I'll be continuing to update this site, or at least updating this blog to keep tabs and talk about my life so I can reflect on it sometime later.

				<h2 class="subtitle">Still Extremely Early Development</h2>
				<h4 class="subdate">January 11th, 2018</h4>

				Hi, Min here again. I actually stopped development for a while since the 5th just interpreting another CSS page for additional code to 
				add to my own CSS. I discovered W3.CSS which would have made development a lot easier, but I don't want to abandon my progress and work
				here. So I extracted some code and rewrote it into my CSS.
				
				<br></br>
				Now I've added some animations to the titles, like how it slides from the left now. I looked through it and interpreted something new I've
				never seen before in CSS: keyframes. Definitely interesting and seems very helpful. Going to look into it more for animation purposes.

				Hi! It's Min, welcome to my website! Well, in development at least, aha.. As you can see, I've already created a few things.
				First, I've created 3 different pages including 'Home', 'About Me', and 'Blog'. I pretty much made these first, since they're pretty
				much the easiest and didn't really require any intermediate code. I watched a few tutorials on <em>YouTube</em> on HTML5 and
				CSS development to reach to my current point. It doesn't look like much, but I've got a pretty decent idea of what I'm doing, and
				my navigation bar looks pretty. :D
				
				<br></br>
				Otherwise I've been having no trouble about much. My logo and other images haven't been created yet, I'll have to design them after
				I'm done creating the base of this website. It's definitely been fun, and I think it's great I'm taking this initiative to delve
				further into the world of code. I feel proud of myself. I really do hope I can get to a point where my website will look much better.
