				Hi, Min here again. I actually stopped development for a while since the 5th just interpreting another CSS page for additional code to 
				add to my own CSS. I discovered W3.CSS which would have made development a lot easier, but I don't want to abandon my progress and work
				here. So I extracted some code and rewrote it into my CSS.
				
				<br></br>
				Now I've added some animations to the titles, like how it slides from the left now. I looked through it and interpreted something new I've
				never seen before in CSS: keyframes. Definitely interesting and seems very helpful. Going to look into it more for animation purposes.

				Hi! It's Min, welcome to my website! Well, in development at least, aha.. As you can see, I've already created a few things.
				First, I've created 3 different pages including 'Home', 'About Me', and 'Blog'. I pretty much made these first, since they're pretty
				much the easiest and didn't really require any intermediate code. I watched a few tutorials on <em>YouTube</em> on HTML5 and
				CSS development to reach to my current point. It doesn't look like much, but I've got a pretty decent idea of what I'm doing, and
				my navigation bar looks pretty. :D
				
				<br></br>
				Otherwise I've been having no trouble about much. My logo and other images haven't been created yet, I'll have to design them after
				I'm done creating the base of this website. It's definitely been fun, and I think it's great I'm taking this initiative to delve
				further into the world of code. I feel proud of myself. I really do hope I can get to a point where my website will look much better.
