				<h2 class="subtitle">Little talk about dance and me</h2>
				<h4 class="subdate">May 6th, 2018 </h4>
				
				<p class="post">
				I think I want to confess about this on my blog. I've always had a bit of an iffy relationship with dance, particularly because of how impatient I am with
				my progress and how much I compare myself to others. Both toxic traits, and somehow something I could never get over even though I tried. It might be because how competitive
				I am, but I really want dance to be more than that for me. I want my dancing to mean something not for myself (because I can already do that), but for others. I want it to
				be like an unspoken language that can be used to communicate with others. I want it to be like a letter that gets through to anyone watching or a specific person. It sounds
				super artsy and a bit selfish, but that is my vision for dance. 
				
				<br></br>
				So to get closer to my goal, I've decided to come to terms with how I am with dance. I compare myself to others. I'm impatient. I'm too serious. Will I be alright with that? Probably not. 
				It could change later as the years go by, but I have to accept that this is how I will think for now, and that I can't be beating myself up over this. I'll just be distracting myself even further.
				I'll receive some hate for confessing this, something I'm really scared of. I think it's time that I faced that instead, and tackled difficult situations head on instead of running or 
				smoothening out my life. I'll have to <i>work with the cards I'm dealt</i>. 
				
				<br></br>
				On another note, I've come so far in this journey. Hit my 1st year anniversary. This should be a time I'm celebrating, for having done dance on <b>my own volition</b> for an year, 
				something I've practically never done in my life. Yet I don't, simply upset over my current level and growth. I never learned anything on my own, so this itself should have been expected.
				I don't believe I've grown as much as people have told me. I seek too much improvement and hold the highest of expectations upon myself like a simple fool. Even so, I don't see the slightest of improvements
				I've been seeking. All this expectation, comes out of hope. Alongside my wish to be able to communicate my feelings to people through dance, I also wish to be at a point where I can dance at a similar level 
				or with some uniqueness to all my friends, whom are all far ahead of me through experience or skill. I want to join them and stand where they are. I want to understand them and them to understand me. 
				I want to be a part of their group, their family, without getting hurt or being afraid. Ironic how my confidence completely drained after my return to Mississauga.
				
				<br></br>
				To end on a good note, I've decided to try a different method of picking up class and learning grooves or moves, a suggestion from someone I consider a mentor. I'm going to try a lot of different
				things and try not to rely or return to my roots of learning how to dance, considering it doesn't seem to be working for me. Get out of my comfort zone in every way I can.
				
				<br></br>
				
				I may hurt people for having said all this, but I think it needs to be said. For me to move on, and for others to know. I'll be grinding my entire 4 months before I go to Guelph with
				dance, and if that doesn't do much, I'll probably be all upset and shit. But whatever. I'm pretty sure I'll keep pushing even if I'm down for the count. That's what I've
				been doing throughout my entire dance career.

				<h2 class="subtitle">Before the complete lock-out</h2>
				<h4 class="subdate">May 5th, 2018</h4>
				
				<p class="post">
				A friend of mine recently suggested I keep up with blog posting for this new 'life-style' change I've been trying. I've become more
				self-aware of my weight and appearance again, so I decided to go on a salad diet. However, that's not the biggest change in my life-style so far.
				I've decided to lock myself out of social media (on the exception of Instagram for the purpose of keeping that option open for those that don't have my number).
				Otherwise, I have sort of etched into it recently before the actual lockout begins. I've deleted all social media apps except IG and have simply been keeping watch
				of my FB texts through the website with rare replies. 
				
				<br></br>
				
				Frankly, I'm hoping this will do well on my mental health. I've always come out online conversations or chats
				with the fear of being judged and wondering if people see me as annoying or boring. It always felt like one or the other after this experience I've had. And frankly,
				I wouldn't be surprised if it's true. I think I'm annoying and boring, but I also hope people can see what I can offer. 
				
				<br></br> 
				
				Off the small rant, I actually think it's done some wonders recently even tho I've been using social media so lightly. I've gotten much more productive the past few days with
				dance, still waiting on my QA to give me a go-ahead to merge my data into the main develop branch for my side-job, and maintaining myself through jogs and my job. My mood dramatically
				lightened up in average. I've tried to control my mood before, but it seems like this is more of a real solution than the never-ending attempts I've made. In contrast,
				I recently replied to a chat today, for some reason, and attempted to clear my facebook chat to control myself further. But I was confronted and I felt myself fall back into this void 
				of fear, of being judged and shamed. Ironically, that's also where I was introduced with the idea of writing a vlog. But I wonder if people will even read this? 
				
				<br></br>
				
				I will be posting on this blog for a week with no contact in social media. I may post for longer, I'm not sure. However if this week goes extremely smoothly without
				social media, I will likely be looking at this life-style change as a concrete one.

				<h2 class="subtitle">Why did this development stop</h2>
				<h4 class="subdate">April 15th, 2018</h4>
				
				<p class="post">
				I'm back, and it's been at least a few months since I did a tiny update on myself. If you've noticed in the projects tab, I actually added 
				and new 'In Progress' project. I've been recruited for a very simple job, to write data for puzzles and perhaps even write functions. Honestly,
				I was sort of excited going into it because it seemed like a coding task and that I would learn something from this. But all I've been doing is
				designing puzzles, putting it into the data file or the beta file for testing, then pushing it, and waiting. I'm pretty grateful that Ken gave me
				a task but I'm also upset with the fact I'm not really getting much out of this but some insight to the code (which I've definitely learned quite a bit through).
				I had the option to say no, but I didn't because, I guess I expected more. 
				
				<br></br>
				
				After this task is done, I need to find my motivation to code again. Whether it is to upgrade and update this site, or to design a game and create it,
				something has to happen. I'm not progressing with my free time, other than making money off my full-time job in the food industry. That's not how I want
				to spend this opportunity. 
				
				<br></br>
				
				I hope I'll be continuing to update this site, or at least updating this blog to keep tabs and talk about my life so I can reflect on it sometime later.

				<h2 class="subtitle">Still Extremely Early Development</h2>
				<h4 class="subdate">January 11th, 2018</h4>
				
				<p class="post">
				Hi, Min here again. I actually stopped development for a while since the 5th just interpreting another CSS page for additional code to 
				add to my own CSS. I discovered W3.CSS which would have made development a lot easier, but I don't want to abandon my progress and work
				here. So I extracted some code and rewrote it into my CSS.
				
				<br></br>
				Now I've added some animations to the titles, like how it slides from the left now. I looked through it and interpreted something new I've
				never seen before in CSS: keyframes. Definitely interesting and seems very helpful. Going to look into it more for animation purposes.

				<h4 class="subdate">January 2nd, 2018</h4>
			
				<p class="post">
				Hi! It's Min, welcome to my website! Well, in development at least, aha.. As you can see, I've already created a few things.
				First, I've created 3 different pages including 'Home', 'About Me', and 'Blog'. I pretty much made these first, since they're pretty
				much the easiest and didn't really require any intermediate code. I watched a few tutorials on <em>YouTube</em> on HTML5 and
				CSS development to reach to my current point. It doesn't look like much, but I've got a pretty decent idea of what I'm doing, and
				my navigation bar looks pretty. :D
				
				<br></br>
				Otherwise I've been having no trouble about much. My logo and other images haven't been created yet, I'll have to design them after
				I'm done creating the base of this website. It's definitely been fun, and I think it's great I'm taking this initiative to delve
				further into the world of code. I feel proud of myself. I really do hope I can get to a point where my website will look much better.
