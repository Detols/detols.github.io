			<header>
		
		<p class = "post">My full name is Eric Minseo Park, but call me Min. I'm 20 years old, choreograph and train in hip hop
		and urban dance, code and design projects like this, or play boardgames with friends.

		<br></br>
		
		I dropped out of <em>The University of Waterloo</em>'s Honors Mathematics program
		after realizing the career path wasn't for me. I decided to invest my current time in training my fundamental
		abilities to be completely prepared for a career in programming. This includes time management, critical thinking,
		practical ability (coding), and judgement. 
		
		<br></br>
		
		Now I am studying at the <em>University of Guelph</em>'s Software Engineering (Co-Op) program, and am in my 2nd year.
		Enjoying and appreciating everything that I've been learning so far, and trying to put it into use through projects.
