			<header>
		
		<p class = "post">My full name is Eric Minseo Park, but call me Min. I'm currently 18, working
		a full time job as a cook. On my spare time I often practice my
		technical skills in <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em>, practice hip hop
		choreography, or code and design projects like this. I do occasionally binge on youtube or anime, but
		now I'm keeping to my new years resolution to set my priorities straight!

		<br></br>
		
		I dropped out of <em>The University of Waterloo</em>'s Honors Mathematics program
		after realizing the career path wasn't for me. I decided to invest my current time in training my fundamental
		abilities to be completely prepared for a career in programming. This includes time management, critical thinking,
		practical ability (coding), and judgement. 
		
		<br></br>
		
		I am now setting my sights on <em>The University
		of Guelph</em>'s Honors Software Engineering program, <em>The University of Toronto</em>'s Honors Computer Science
		program, and <em>The University of Western Ontario</em>'s Honors Computer Science program.
